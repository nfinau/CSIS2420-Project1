# Project 1 Scope

## Goal
Implement the required functionality described in the Project 1 spec and provide verification evidence for correctness.

## In Scope
- All features explicitly required by the assignment specification
- Input validation (handle invalid/edge inputs as required)
- Clear output formatting matching examples
- Verification evidence (documented test cases + results)

## Out of Scope
- UI/extra features not requested
- Performance optimizations beyond what is required
- Additional enhancements unless the spec explicitly asks

## Assumptions / Constraints
- Language/runtime: Java (JDK 17+), console application executed from command line
- Input format: Program reads input from standard input (keyboard) following the format specified in the assignment instructions
- Output format: Text output printed to standard output exactly matching the required formatting in the specification
- Edge-case handling: follow spec; if unclear, document decision in design notes
